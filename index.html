        <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>

        <p> Python is an OOP. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.</p>

        <p> Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>

        <p>Python is the leading language of choice for many data scientists. Python has grown in popularity within the field due to the availability of many excellent libraries focused on data science (of which NumPy and Pandas are two of the most well-known) and data visualisation (like Matplotlib and Seaborn). Pyton really made Data crunching fun with all its numerous available libraries. Ipython with JupyterLab is another form of Python that improves the usage of Python in the field of data science.</p>

        <p>Python is a very flexible language that can be used to automate boring or repetitive tasks. System administrators often use it by writing scripts which can be easily executed from the terminal. Python can also be used to create bots which automate some of our daily tasks.</p>

        <p>Python is one of the best languages suited for machine learning, deep learning and data analytics with a stronghold in all of them.
  There are specialized languages best suited for various role such as R and MATLAB, but when it comes to overlapping fields of applications python wins hands down due to its flexibility and rapid prototyping and availability of libraries.</p>

        <p>To print a string in Python, just write: 
          <code> print('Hello Word') </code></p>
        <p>It's really easy to print something with Python. You can print out words, like for 'Hello World':
          <code> print('This is what I want to print!!')</code></p>
        <p>You can easily use mathematical operators directly with the print function: 
          <code> print(1+2)</code>
          <code>print(2*6)</code>
          <code>print(6/3)</code>
        </p>
